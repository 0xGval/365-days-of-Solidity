# 365 Days of Solidity

**A public proof-of-work project**

This repository documents a one-year journey focused on learning Solidity through consistent, hands-on practice.

The goal is to write, test, and deploy **365 smart contracts**, one per day, with gradually increasing complexity. Each contract is deployed on a testnet and accompanied by tests, deployment scripts, and short explanations of the design choices involved.

This project is intended as a **public proof of work**, showcasing real, practical experience in smart contract development rather than purely theoretical knowledge.

## Background

I do not have a formal Computer Science background.  
I come from the crypto space and I am a self-taught developer who has studied and built applications independently over the years.

Over the past months, I started studying Solidity in a structured way. This repository represents the next step: a disciplined, transparent, and verifiable learning process focused on real-world smart contract development.

## Project Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Solidity and EVM concepts  
- Learn and implement common patterns used in production smart contracts  
- Write readable, well-tested, and explainable code  
- Gain hands-on experience with deployment workflows on testnets  
- Document learning progress and technical tradeoffs  
- Create a solid proof of work for future Solidity / Web3 roles

## What This Repository Contains

Each smart contract in this repository focuses on a specific concept or pattern.

For every topic, the project includes:
- Solidity smart contracts  
- Automated tests  
- Deployment scripts  
- Short notes or README files explaining what was built and why  

The emphasis is on **progressive complexity**, not on producing isolated or copy-pasted examples.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by thematic phases (weeks or topics), rather than as a flat list of files.

High-level structure:

- `src/` — Solidity contracts grouped by topic  
- `test/` — Automated tests  
- `script/` — Deployment scripts  
- `docs/` — Roadmap and learning notes  

The structure may evolve over time as the project grows.

## Roadmap (High Level)

The learning path follows a gradual progression:

- Solidity fundamentals (storage, functions, modifiers, errors)  
- Access control and common design patterns  
- Token standards (ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155)  
- Cross-contract interactions  
- DeFi primitives (staking, vaults, simplified AMMs)  
- Security concepts and attack simulations  
- Gas optimization and advanced patterns  
- Upgradeability and proxy patterns  

The roadmap is intentionally flexible and may be adjusted based on learning needs.

---

## Tooling

This project uses standard tools from the Ethereum ecosystem:

- Solidity  
- Foundry (testing, scripting, deployment)  
- Ethereum testnets (e.g. Sepolia)  

Every contract is designed to be:
- Testable  
- Deployable  
- Readable by third parties  

---

## Philosophy

This repository is not a collection of perfect examples.  
It is a **real learning process**.

Refactors, mistakes, and improvements are expected and documented.  
The focus is on:
- consistent progress  
- understanding tradeoffs  
- developing good engineering habits  

---

## Disclaimer

All contracts are deployed **only on testnets**.  
The code is not audited and **must not be used in production**.

## Feedback

Feedback, suggestions, and reviews are welcome.  
This project is public to encourage discussion, learning, and continuous improvement.
